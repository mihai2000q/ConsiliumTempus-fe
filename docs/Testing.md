# Consilium Tempus Frontend Testing

* [Unit Testing](#unit-testing)
  * [Coding Convention](#coding-convention)

The frontend of the application is tested using the **jest** framework. 
The tests are only covering Unit Testing.

## Unit Testing

The Unit tests are designed to test single units of code in isolation. 
They are quick and facile to create, and help find and fix bugs early in the development cycle. 
They can be typically run using the IDE by right-clicking any of them. 

Otherwise, to run all the unit tests, the following command can be used in the terminal:
```sh
something
```
